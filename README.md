## Assignment 4

### Feedback

1. Client 1 (Darius)

In the home page at the top left there is a clock that tells you the actual hour but it could be a problem with the code and it may not be a creator's decision. The main page has multiple things such as a big image of the company logo and it also has a big title with the company name. The navbar is easy to use and useful because it has all the pages that can be accessible throught the website. In the middle of the page there is a big picture of the deals that can be purchase in the website which in my opinion is a very good idea because you can go straight to the page of the deals. Below there are multiple link to different pages and also different pictures correlated to the page linked, an example can be that there are multiple pictures of phones in the phones section, phone cases in phone cases section and so on. The navbar is very easy to use and it is very useful to jump from a page to another without having to go to the home page everytime.
Going in to the first page we got the phone page, we can see different phones that are shown on which there are links below then that takes you on different pages of the website to buy them, the design of the page is simple and good without any problems, also to annotate here on the phones page the clock works perfectly so it may be something with the code of the first page.
Going for the second page called cases which is a page focused on the cases for the phone also called phone cases, the design is the same as the other page so it may be a decision made by the creator or it may be a mistaken. 
Going to the third page we have the chargers and the whole page is focused on the chargers for phones, however again the design of the page is the same of the other pages. In this page we got multiple choices for chargers such as chargers with the plug or without the plug. 
For the fourth page we got the Headphones and same thing, the design is the same however it has multiple choices of headphones, an example can be the plug meaning if it is type C/ Cable C or it can be stereo cable or it can be wireless.
For the next page which is deals of the month we can see that the website has a multiple of choice between products because we can see multiple things such as a choice of phones, headphones, chargers, and phone cases which is a very good thing and it is clever.
On the next page we can find the contact us page in which you can fill the form and send it to the company for some feedback which is a good and easy thing because you don't have to neccessary call them or email them and wait for them to respond.
The next is called About us, however for what I can see there is nothing here but it can be still in progress.

The first thing I think the creator should do is first to adjust the clock on the first page because it doesn't work.

The second thing that I think the creator should adjust/change it to change design on different pages if it is not the final design.

The third thing that I think the creator should change is the About us page because there is nothing when I am doing this feedback.

Overall the feedback what Darius gave was possitive however there was a few things that needed improving. I agree with the improvements Darius gave me about adjusting the clock so it works and add content to the About us page on the website and will doing/fixing the improvements in the resubmission of the assignment.

### Task 4

Overall the website I created meets the user requirements because it’s easy to navigate since there is a nav bar and buttons what stand out to take you to different pages of the website and the font is easy to read because it’s a simple font making it easy to use by people with reading disabilities it’s also a responsive design because it works on both pc and phones there are multiple pictures to look at on the website of phones, headsets, chargers and cases the website loads fast overall giving the user a better experience viewing the website.

The initial design of the website I had put the title on the right hand side of the logo on all pages but I decided to change the design and put the title on the top centre of the page the reason behind this change was because I preferred the look of the title being this way and it's also the first thing the viewer of the website will see so it lets them know there on the correct page of the website. The second change I decided to make is I made the buttons take up the whole width of the page instead of having them being a smaller button above the pictures the reason I made this change was I preferred the look of it, and it makes the buttons stand out more, so the users know it’s there. The third change I decided to make is with the contact page it was originally going to have to pages one with the company details with some text with a link guiding you to the message page and the other having a form so you can write your own message and send it straight to the company the reason I made that change is because I thought it would make the process of contacting the company more confusing so I just put the form on the Contact us page. The fourth change I decided to make is with the logo it was Originally going to be a hotspot guiding you back to the home page, but I didn't know how to do it, so I scraped the idea and just left it as a picture.
